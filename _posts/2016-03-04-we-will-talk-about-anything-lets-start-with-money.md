Have you ever asked yourself, or others, "What is money"?  
How does it "work"?  
How can a piece of paper have any "real value"?  
And most important:

**Where does money come _from_?**

You are not alone. Starting very soon, I will dedicate a significant portion of the time I'll be spending writing on this site trying to explain this (most times) obscure subject.

Why? Well... over the past few months, I, perhaps coincidentally, perhaps incidentally, have been exposed to this subject in a myriad ways, more than those I can _actually _attribute to chance. These "fortuitous" encounters with the inner workings of the money system led me to read, listen, watch and, as a general, avidly consume all and any materials on the subject I could get my hands (and sensory organs) on.

What I found left me, for a lack of a better term, astonished. And I think I could actually convey the general idea about money in a way that can be more "digestible" by the general public, and in - maybe, and that is a _big maybe_ - fewer words and abstract concepts as those I have consulted upon.

So, hopefully, this interests some of you out there, and maybe you will share this with someone else, whom will (maybe) share it with someone else too.

And who knows... maybe, what starts here as the mere musings of a heavily disgruntled citizen of the World, could be useful to some as inspiration to gain some insight into the most aberrant, horrendous and ultimately evil\* control mechanism Man inflicted over Man.

\*By "evil" I mean  profoundly immoral - as in "no decent person could come up with this"; this is not aligned with the "other" evil - you know, the horn and hooves variant.
